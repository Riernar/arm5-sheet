## Sheet's documentation

The sheet documentation can be found:

- [Here](documentation.md) in this repo
- Directly in the sheet, by clicking the circled `?` icon in the top-right corner.

## Getting help

- Ask on the [unofficial Ars Magica 5th Discord](https://discord.gg/9M9fhwr6T9) in the
  `#roll20-vtt` channel and tag `@riernar`. This is where Riernar is mostly active.

- Open an issue in the [sheet's dedicated repository][sheet-repository].

- (Not recommended) Open an issue in [Roll20's community sheet
  repository][roll20-sheet-repo]. This is not recommended as Riernar checks there much
  less often.

> [!WARNING]  
> If you open your issue in the Roll20's repository, tag `@Riernar` in your message, this
> will increase the chance I see your issue.

## Bugs, feature requests and feedback

1. Check that the bug/feature request doesn't already exist in the
   [sheet's dedicated repository](https://github.com/Riernar/arm5-sheet/issues).
2. Open a new bug report or feature request

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Please report bug or feature request only in the dedicated repository, it makes tracking
> issues and progress much easier.
